# Performance Benchmarks

`gluestack-ui` harnesses the power of [`gluestack-style`](https://style.gluestack.io), a universal and highly performant styling library, to create beautifully styled components. **With a babel plugin for pre-computing styles during the build process, and runtime performance optimizations, gluestack-style delivers high performance styling, even in the most demanding applications.**

# React Native

We performed the [benchmarks](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui-benchmarks) with some famous React Native libraries like gluestack-ui, Tamagui, NativeBase, Styled Components and React Native built-in styling.

**In each case we have rendered 1000 components with styling of each library. Results are average of 5 mounts.**

> **All the benchmarks were measured in production environment on iPhone 13.**

## Simple Component

This benchmark is based on the time it taken to render simple themed components. We've developed a Box component using View with some default styles.

<Graph
  data={{
    'gluestack-ui': 153,
    'React Native': 76,
    'Tamagui': 160,
    'Styled Components': 91,
    'NativeBase': 529,
  }}
/>

## Component with variants

This benchmark is based on the time tyaken to render components with different variations. We've developed a Box component using View with default styles and multiple variants.

<Graph
  data={{
    'gluestack-ui': 164,
    'React Native': 76,
    'Tamagui': 186,
    'Styled Components': 103,
    'NativeBase': 666,
  }}
/>

> Styled Components doesn't have built-in support for variants. We've incorporated prop-based variants into Styled Components.

## Component with default theme and inline styles

This benchmark is based on rendering component with default themes, variations, inline styles, and state styles. We've designed a Button component using Pressable with default style, variations, state style, and inline styles.

<Graph
  data={{
    'gluestack-ui': 395,
    'React Native': 195,
    'Tamagui': 533,
    'Styled Components': 239,
    'NativeBase': 1207,
  }}
/>

## Layout using HStack, VStack, Image and Text

This benchmark is based on creating a layout with HStack, VStack, Image, and Text to display a list of 28 items. We've utilized components from the following libraries for this purpose.

<Graph
  data={{
    'gluestack-ui': 120,
    'React Native': 69,
    'Tamagui': 90,
    'NativeBase': 491,
  }}
/>

> Note: This test was taken from [Tamagui](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/24ac758bbe5d6ff2f67f25071df4286e0594f578/starters/benchmark).

# Web

We are actively working on benchmarks for web, updates will be available soon.
