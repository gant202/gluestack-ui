# Themed Library

`@gluestack-ui/themed`, a themed component library, is a collection of pre-designed user interface components that are styled according to a specific theme or design language. These components are reusable, consistent, interactive and are accessible on web, iOS, and Android.

All the components of `@gluestack-ui/themed` are styled according to the default theme. This default theme ensures a consistent and polished visual identity. gluestack-ui simplifies the development process by wrapping your app within the `GluestackUIProvider` and passing the configuration as a parameter, you instantly unlock the magic of seamless styling.

## Architecture

We will try and understand how the components exported from `@gluestack-ui/themed` are created. Initially, we generate styled components using the [gluestack-style](https://style.gluestack.io/) styling engine. This allows us to customize styles, use theme tokens, provide styling for dark and light modes, and respond to different screen sizes using `@gluestack-style/react`. The specifics like themes, tokens, and breakpoints are defined in a configuration file.

After that, we enhance the components with accessibility features, interactivity, and more using `@gluestack-ui`. This library provides creator functions that take our styled components and transform them into fully functional components. Once our components are both user-friendly and interactive, we bundle them together into a new package called `@gluestack-ui/themed`, which we can then easily use in our projects.

## Features

`@gluestack-ui/themed` uses `@gluestack-style/react` for styling components, it provides features such as:

- Tokens
- Themes
- Overwriting components base styles

`@gluestack-ui/themed` exports a config file that allows us to manipulate the theme tokens and add new themes. Theme tokens are standardized values that represent various design attributes, such as colors, typography settings, spacing, and more. These tokens serve as a consistent and centralized way to define and manage the visual properties of UI components across your application. These tokens can also be customized. For more information refer to this [doc](https://ui.gluestack.io/docs/theme/customizing-tokens).

Support for multiple themes is also available. This can be achieved by updating the config file and adjusting the tokens accordingly for different themes.

Component styling is accomplished through [`@gluestack-style/react`](https://style.gluestack.io/). You can customize the styles of each component. Detailed information is available [here](https://ui.gluestack.io/docs/theme/customizing-components).
